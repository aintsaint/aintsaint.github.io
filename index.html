		There’s nothing to look at. 
		There’s nothing to be interested in. 
		Except for th<a href="https://www.instagram.com/samaintsaint/">i</a>s cat.

		Yet you believe there is, and your own cat is looking weird at ya. 

		But there isn’t. Save for a shimmering thought that curiosity has to be rewarded with a result. Or maybe a hint. 

		So, how about this: 

		There is no satisfaction of your curiosity in whatever you may ever see here. What you’re actually looking for is what brought you here. 

		Now, rest. </p>
